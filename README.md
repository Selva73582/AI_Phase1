project title : Fake News Detection Using NLP

project description :
The "Fake News Detection Using NLP" project is a critical initiative in the era of digital information, where the dissemination of false or misleading news articles can have significant societal and political implications. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can effectively identify and classify news articles as either authentic or fake by utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Dataset Source:

The "True.csv" and "Fake.csv" datasets used in this project were obtained from reputable and publicly accessible sources. The datasets contain news articles labeled as either "real" or "fake." 

To run the "Fake News Detection Using NLP" project, you will need the following libraries and packages:

Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.

NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.

scikit-learn (sklearn): For machine learning tools and models, including TF-IDF vectorization and classification algorithms.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing, tokenization, and stopwords removal.
